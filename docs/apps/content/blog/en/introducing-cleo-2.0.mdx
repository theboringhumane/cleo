# 🚀 Introducing Cleo 2.0

We're thrilled to announce the release of Cleo 2.0, a major update to our distributed task processing framework. This release brings significant improvements in task management, group processing, monitoring capabilities, and developer experience.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Enhanced Task Decorators

The `@task` decorator now provides more granular control over task execution:

```typescript
@task({
  id: "process-video",
  priority: TaskPriority.HIGH,
  queue: "media",
  group: "video-processing",
  backoff: {
    type: "exponential",
    delay: 1000
  },
  weight: 10,
  removeOnComplete: true
})
```

- **Smart Backoff Strategies**: Choose between exponential and fixed backoff for retries
- **Task Weights**: Prioritize tasks within groups
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically remove completed tasks
- **Event Filtering**: Precise event handling with taskId filtering

### Intelligent Group Processing

Improved group processing with multiple strategies:

- **Round Robin**: Fair distribution with last-processed time tracking
- **FIFO**: Strict order processing with complete task history
- **Priority-based**: Dynamic priority adjustment with group statistics

### Comprehensive Monitoring

Enhanced observability with detailed metrics:

- **Worker Metrics**: Track processing time, success rates, and resource usage
- **Group Statistics**: Monitor group performance and task distribution
- **Task History**: Complete audit trail of task lifecycle events
- **Real-time Events**: Comprehensive event system for monitoring

### Production-Ready Features

New capabilities for production deployments:

- **Multi-tenant Support**: Redis key prefixing for tenant isolation
- **Enhanced Security**: TLS support and secure Redis connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Control processing rates at queue and group levels
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean worker shutdown with task completion

## 💡 Developer Experience

We've focused on making Cleo more developer-friendly:

### Simplified Configuration

```typescript
cleo.configure({
  redis: {
    host: "redis.example.com",
    tls: true,
    keyPrefix: "tenant1:"
  },
  worker: {
    concurrency: 10,
    maxMemoryUsage: 1024 * 1024 * 512
  }
});
```

### Intuitive Queue Classes

```typescript
@QueueClass({
  defaultOptions: {
    queue: "notifications",
    maxRetries: 3
  },
  includeInherited: true
})
class NotificationService {
  // Methods automatically become tasks
}
```

### Type-Safe Event Handling

```typescript
queueManager.onTaskEvent(ObserverEvent.TASK_COMPLETED, 
  (taskId, status, data) => {
    console.log(`Task ${taskId} completed with result:`, data.result);
});
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Redis Operations**: Reduced Redis operations per task
- **Smart Caching**: Improved caching of task and group metadata
- **Efficient Event Handling**: Filtered event propagation
- **Memory Management**: Better memory usage in long-running workers

## 🔄 Migration Guide

Upgrading from Cleo 1.x is straightforward:

1. Update dependencies to 2.0.0
2. Replace deprecated retry options with new backoff configuration
3. Update event handlers to use taskId filtering
4. Review and update group processing strategies

## 🎯 What's Next?

We're already working on exciting features for future releases:

- GraphQL API for task management
- Kubernetes integration
- Machine learning powered scheduling
- Enhanced dashboard features
- Additional processing strategies
