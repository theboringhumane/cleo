## [1.0.9] - "Confident Hofstadter" - 2025-01-27

### 🚀 New Features
#### Client-Server Architecture
- 🔄 Implemented new CleoClient and CleoWorker classes for distributed task management
- 🌐 Added seamless integration with NextJS and Bun
- 📦 Enhanced queue management system with improved worker handling

#### 🏗 Architecture Overview

    end
```

#### 💻 Technical Implementation
**Client Implementation:**
```javascript
import { CleoClient } from 'cleo';

const client = new CleoClient({
  endpoint: 'worker-url',
  options: {
    // client configuration
  }
});

await client.scheduleTask({
  type: 'processData',
  payload: {...}
});
```

**Worker Implementation:**
```javascript
import { CleoWorker } from 'cleo';

const worker = new CleoWorker({
  tasks: {
    processData: async (payload) => {
      // task implementation
    }
  }
});

worker.start();
```
